We are group of Cyber Security Enthusiasts with diverse skills working togther to evangelise Computer Security in NIT Delhi.

Founded in Spring Semester of 2017, Mohit approached to Shivam, Vighnesh, Abhay, Parvez as he was in search for students who had experience working on Linux systems to make a team to conduct a Jeopardy style CTF in NITD's annual Tech Fest TerraTechnica 2017. 
The event was a success and it was the first time TerraTechnica had a CTF event. 

Since this team for CTF event had common interests, we started with group discussions sharing progress on our personal projects. We thought we can do better hence the beginning of CyberSec NITD.

## What we do

Work on our Personal projects, share knowledge, talk about topic concerning Computer Security.

We host weekly meetups where we give talks, discuss on the new topics and help other members.

We attend meetups by [ILUGD](http://ilugd.github.io/), NULL CON, SegFault, [PyDelhi](http://pydelhi.org/) and sometimes give talks too.
