The time has come to do it again!

Root CTF, a CTF event organized by **CyberSecNITD** every year in [TerraTechnica](https://terratechnica.in) NITD's Annual Techfest.

The CTF was Jeopardy style and was conducted in offline mode.

We witnessed 11 teams having students from NITD and from other Colleges too.
That was a huge progress for us from RootCTF17 where all our participants were students from NITD only.

Since last year's CTF, we got the opportunity to learn more on topics in CyberSecurity. Our Daily meetups forced us to learn 
more concepts in computer security, and now helped in designing better challenges.

## Challenges

Compared to last year, we had more challenges in Cryptography and Reverse Engineering.

Participants spent more time on these categories possibly due to its difficulty.

> Shivam, those binary challenges weren't easy

## Behind the Scene

We had a lot of fun moments while building these challenges!

Shivam, the man who grok Binary Analysis and reverse engineering, designed all the challenges in *Reverse Engineering* category. 
One could meet him around the hallways, brainstorming with Buffer Overflow, ROP and never left anyone without giving a talk on LD_PRELOAD.

Abhay worked on the web challenges, *Russian Security* challenge was designed by him. Interestingly, none of us went over the thought of 
working with headers, like a newb we searched around for cookies or hidden URLs. Our love to TV Series Mr.Robot always reflect as a
challenge in RootCTF18, and Abhay just did that with *YUMMY*.

I worked on Cryptography challenges. *Piggy Bank* challenge was based on bacon codes a suggestion by Shivam, 
for which I came up the idea of using terminal color codes to embed the bacon codes. 
It was only on the event I had to note that people were using Window machine and opened the text file in Notepad.
I designed it to show the colors when you cat the file, so people with Notepad exploring the text had additional overhead solving the challenge.
And it end up being the least solved challenge. Oh wait we got unsolved challenges too!

All our challenges went though a QA session by Mohit.
Once Mohit, while looking at a Binary challenge designed by Shivam. He managed to spawn a reverse shell where he ran `shutdown` on Shivam's machine pissing him off. Once a BH Hacker always be a BH hacker.

There were some challenges that didn't make it to the competition and some challenges we didn't plan to add before.

## Post thoughts

The event was a success. Participants gave us positive feedback respecting the difficulty of the challenges.
Yes, Shivam those binary challenges weren't a noob's play.

Next time, we'll be taking this event online luring more participants and also allow us to put up challenges that require more time to solve.

This was also the last time we'll have Mohit helping out in the event as its time for him to bid goodbye to NITD. It was his idea to start 
this event, we had great time working together and ran the event 2 times.


Thanks to him we have RootCTF and Cybersec NITD
