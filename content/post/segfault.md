Okay, we were shut for a very long time! Our founders graduated, things were dormant. It's time for a change.

It all started with conversation with a freshman, I told them we had a club and probably we can do a meetup to bring it back. So, I decided to start with 
a new workshop series which I have given the name - **"Segfault"**.

Segfault will be a series of workshops on reverse engineering. And today, we hosted our first workshop!

This workshop was exclusively for first year students as they have covered their C programming course which will be heavily referred in the following workshops. I'm happy to see this reviving process being just like the founding days where we used do Binary analysis for the CTF we planned.

> My goal is to teach students to reverse engineer real software and develop hacks/exploits for it. It could be a game, android app or common software.

This journey requires a lot of patience, as there are a lot of concepts, topics and experiments to be covered to reach a stage of real hacking.

## Important stuff here!

The resources and a little summary of the workshop will be updated here along with links to slides and references. Because a good coder always documents his/her cluster spaghetti.
