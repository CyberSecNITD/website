Today we collaborated with IEEE NITD Student Branch and organized a Introductory workshop.

Since being an independent club with students of common interest we thought it would be better if we do some serious workshop helping the freshman year students jump into the CyberSecurity Band Wagon!

The crowd we received was impressive! We never had a meetup with such a huge crowd before.

Since we are bunch of students with mediocre GPA trying to bust our keyboard typing out cryptic words what we describe as *commands* on dumb boring terminal doesn't easily qualify as a Club with organization and publicity, today was important.

## The session

It started with...

![Technical Difficulties](/images/technical-difficulties.jpg)

We figured it out, after all ain't we engineering students.


I gave a very very brief as A in Apple of CyberSecurity as quick as possible, here are the [slides](/slides/19feb_introduction_to_cybersec/index.html).


And then we moved on this interesting part of CyberSecurity, **Binary Analysis** (hah! fears of [rootctf18](/events/rootctf18))


In order to give the audience a hands on experience, Abhay had his laptop open to all to SSH into and work, deadly stuff. But it was fun, we managed to deliever such an experience without much hiccups, shoo away the windoge and loonix barriers.

Abhay talked about how commercial softwares are cracked. He demonstrated the simplest possible "haxx" but trust me back then during rootctf17 when Mohit showed the same we all stood jaw dropped.


Then we discussed on Binary formats, ELF, deuggging symbols and not long before tried to get into `gdb`, we ran short of time :(. 


The holy grail of Binary Analysis a.k.a `gdb` had to be kept aside for another session.

## Thank you IEEE NITD Student Branch!


Shoutout to Anuveksh Taneja and Revti Raman for the collaboration and also successfully setting up IEEE NITD Student Branch. 


Their efforts on organizing workshops on various topics of Interests is a huge benefit to freshman and sophomores. 


Thanks for helping us out! We are looking forward have a SIG on cybersecurity up soon!
