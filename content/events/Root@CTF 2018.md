The time has come to do it again!

Root CTF, a CTF event organized by us every year in [TerraTechnica](https://terratechnica.in)

The CTF is Jeopardy style and is conducted in offline mode.

## Behind the Scenes

Since last year's CTF, we got the opportunity to learn more on topics in CyberSecurity. Our Daily meetups forced us to learn 
more concepts in computer security, and now helped up design better challenges.

Shivam seemed to grok Binary Analysis and reverse engineering started working on *Binary Challenges*. One could meet him around
the hallways, brainstorming with Buffer Overflow, ROP and never left anyone without giving a talk on LD_PRELOAD.

Damn, we had a lot of Reversing Challenges, Shivam is one Binary challenges geneator machine.

Abhay came up with web challenges, *Russian Security* challenges was designed by him. Interestingly, none of us went over the thought of 
working with headers, like a newb we searched around for cookies or hidden URLs.

I worked on Cryptography challenges. *Bacon challenge* was a suggestion by Shivam, for which I came up with using terminal color codes to 
embed the bacon codes. It was only on the event I had to note that people were using Window machine and opened the text file in Notepad.
I designed it to show the colors when you cat the file, so people with Notepad exploring the text had additional overhead solving the challenge.

All our challenges went though QA by Mohit.
Once Mohit while looking at a Binary challenge by Shivam. He managed to get a reverse shell where he ran `shutdown` pissing Shivam off.
But it's a QA, this needs to put into analysis.

This year we hosted our 2nd Root CTF in Tech Fest of NIT, Delhi.
